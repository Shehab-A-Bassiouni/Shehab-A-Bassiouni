I'm Shehab, a software engineer who graduated from the facility of computer and information sciences at Ain Shams University.

 I'm currently studying systems development and software architecture at the <a href="https://iti.gov.eg/iti/home">ITI</a> <a href="https://iti.gov.eg/iti/programs/details/9M">in the 9-month camp</a>.

I have respected knowledge in the majority of computer science fields.

 I am seeking an opportunity to work as a software engineer or .net developer at a good-environment company to apply my knowledge and gain more experience.
