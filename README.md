I'm Shehab, a software engineer who graduated from the <a href="https://cis.asu.edu.eg/">facility of computer and information sciences at Ain Shams University</a>.

 I'm currently studying systems development and software architecture at the <a href="https://iti.gov.eg/iti/home">ITI</a> in the 9-month camp.

I have respected knowledge in the majority of computer science fields.

 I am seeking an opportunity to work as a <span style="text-decoration:underline">software engineer</span> or <u>.net developer</u> at a good-environment company to apply my knowledge and gain more experience.
